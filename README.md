# Introducing Joe's golang Github Repository

Repository for learning the Go programming language. This is not a real project. It is a testbed for learning. It is a playground. It is a sandbox. 

Write things here. Try out new things. Don't worry too much. Just start writing. Each thing you write here is a seed. It may sprout ðŸŒ± into a plant. If it sprouts, move it to its own pot.
